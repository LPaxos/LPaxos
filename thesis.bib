abstract = {The concept of one event happening before another in a distributed system is examined, and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events. A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events. The use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems. The algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.},

The legislators maintained consistent copies of the parliamentary record, despite their frequent forays from the chamber and the forgetfulness of their messengers. The Paxon parliament's protocol provides a new way of implementing the state machine approach to the design of distributed systems.},

abstract = {I was invited to lecture at the 1998 Marktoberdorf summer school. One reason I accepted was that I was in the process of writing a book on concurrency, and I could use the early chapters of the book as my lecture notes. However, I decided to put aside (perhaps forever) that book and instead write a book on TLA+. I was able to recycle much material from my original notes for the purpose. For the official volume of published notes for the course, I decided to provide this, which is a preliminary draft of the first several chapters of [144].},
